<h2>Project Title: Saadiyat Campus Tour</h2>
<h3>Project Description: This is the website used to present the video "Saadiyat Campus Tour". The idea is to have a website that would highlight a few important spots around the NYUAD Campus, all while providing the opportunity to experience it by ourselves by booking a tour.</h3>

## About the Project
This project is the website I have used to present my 30MFF film. Around the concept of the video, I tried to convey the beauty of our campus by adding a few snapshots of the place, in special the ones that we visited throughout the video. 
<h3>Key Points/Objectives of the website:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Showing around the campus.</li>
<li>Allow viewers to better explore the spots they find interesting.</li>
<li>Give the option to book a tour around campus if they want to.</li>
</ul>

## Concept and Inspiration
Why see it through a screen if you can see it in person?
<br>
<br>
The concept behind this website is the fact that it is pointless to portray such a nice campus without giving users the ability to explore it and possibly see it by themselves. The ones that cannot come to the campus in person will be able to see some of the highlighted spots online, but the ones that can come in person will have the chance to book a tour and view it personally.

## Implementation
For this project, I decided to utilize purely HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Even though I initially toyed around the idea of using Bootstrap and templates, I ultimately decided to challenge myself to use the basics and deal with the inconvenience of that. Thankfully, I did end up learning lots of valuable lessons, and being my first web development experience, I would say it worked out pretty well.
<br>
<br>
For version control, I decided to utilize Github. In specific, I utilized Github Desktop, the client offered by Github to commit and pull without too much command-terminal related hassle. However, being only one person working on the project, the commits felt more like a _"just in case"_ save than an actual commit to the project. I think it will be more interesting in the future

As a last resource, I used a small icon library to make the media buttons pretty. The website could live without that, and I could have also used downloaded icons. However, every designer will understand how much of a pain that would be in terms of sizes, formats, colors and other details. For that reason, I took the short path and added the library.

## Challenges Faced
Thankfully, as a CS major, I did not find big problems in the coding department. However, as a first-time web developer and a person with absolutely no experience whatsoever in design, thinking about the website was a hard task. I tinkered around different ideas until I made the wireframe for this project.<br>

I did not think CSS would be hard, but it is a complete new world to explore. I thankfully found a resource that allowed me to work easily on the stylesheet

## Closing Thoughts and Improvements

I think I could have a done a much better job at designing the layout of the website, but ultimately I am proud of my work here. I never designed a website before, so this was an amazing experience. Also, I think there are some smaller details such as font sizes and color discrepacies that would take a lot of time to improve, but certainly can be polished.
<br>
The initial concept, in my opinion, was respected and I fulfilled my purposes for this website and this film, in terms of programming goals and design objectives. I hope everyone likes it and hopefully can see the beauty of our campus.
