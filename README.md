<h3>Key Points/Objectives of the website:</h3>

## Concept
The concept and idea behind my personal portfolio was simple: create a website that will represent my will and personality. Being able to express my thoughts on web design and my approach to content generation and exposition was a great opportunity that was presented in this website, therefore I decided to go with a website that would have very little visual effect, just some subtle user interaction details

## Implementation
For this project, the languages/frameworks utilized were HTML, CSS and JQuery (JavaScript). In addition to this, I added the "Font Awesome" and the "Typed JS" libraries.

The Font Awesome library allows me to insert the logos that describe each of the projects. They are premade, and the huge catalogue the library offers is great for my purposes.

The Typed JS library allows me to do this nice animation that simulates writing character by character. From Javascript, I provide a list of string that will be displayed in a rotational manner.

## Learnings and improvements
This project was something I had been mentalizing myself to do for a long time, but ultimately was unable to have a "great" idea for it. In terms of improvements, I would love to add more subtle effects (mostly movement in the project section) and other multimedia content embedded in the page. Although, as much as I liked the idea, at the end, I realized that a personal website is not a show, it's not a performance and it doesn't need to "shock" people. Truth is, I realized a personal website is nothing more than my own canvas to express my ideas and projects. For me, I want people to know what projects I have worked on or created, I do not need to go crazy with effects and small gimmicks. I completely understand (and have incalculable respect) for the people that do it, but that does not fit my style. I hope people will see my website, and after meeting me, I want them to say "Yes, this website fits you well". That is all I need, and that is all this website intends to say.
